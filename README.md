# ðŸŽˆ remi

That is Remi. You can request or send things to Remi store. But Remi can be a little 
dumb. Don't assume that you'll receive what you've requested or that she will store 
what you've sent. (No, this is not a excuse to my poor implementation, I promise.).

To help Remi in her duty and don't have some headache in using her service, please, 
send the request following the correct structure.
